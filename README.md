# 01-HTML-GIT-CSS-HOMEWORK

I did my best on this assignment to apply all of the html5 tags that I knew to the existing code in their respective logical order.
I added accessible "alt" attributes to all images displayed on the webpage. 
I made sure the heading attributes fall in sequential order. 
I shortened the css file by replacing long names with shorter id tags and consolidating style commands where I could by placing class tags in the html document. 
I added a concise, descriptive title for the webpage.
